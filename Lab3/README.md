## 📌 Lab Overview
This Lab performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a student health dataset. The goal is to identify patterns, distributions, and correlations between academic habits (study hours, projects) and physiological health metrics (heart rate, blood pressure, stress levels).

## 🛠️ Workflow & Methodology
Following a standard Machine Learning and Data Science pipeline, this analysis includes:

1.  **Data Loading & Environment Setup:** - Importing essential libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
    - Handling CSV formatting and defining professional feature names.
2.  **Data Quality Audit & Preprocessing:** - Checking for missing values (NaN) and duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
    - Verifying dataset shape (1,000 records across 15 columns).
3.  **Descriptive Statistical Summary:** - Calculating central tendency and dispersion metrics (Mean, Median, Std Dev) for all health parameters.
4.  **Categorical Analysis (Groupby):** - Analyzing average stress levels across different mood categories to find behavioral patterns.
5.  **Data Visualization:**
    - **Univariate Analysis:** Distribution of Heart Rates using Histograms and KDE plots.
    - **Bivariate Analysis:** Examining the relationship between Weekly Study Hours and Stress Levels using color-coded Scatterplots.
    - **Multivariate Analysis:** Generating a Correlation Heatmap to identify strong drivers of student health risks.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 📊 Key Findings
- Successfully audited and processed a clean dataset of **1,000 student entries**.
- Discovered specific mood-stress correlations through categorical grouping and visualization.
- Mapped health parameters to provide a foundation for future predictive modeling.
