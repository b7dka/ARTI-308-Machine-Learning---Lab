# Lab 2: Dataset Selection and Methodology

## Project: Phishing Email Detection
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can distinguish between legitimate emails and phishing attempts based on various features.

### Dataset Information:
- **Source:** Kaggle (Phishing Email Dataset).
- **Problem Type:** Classification.
- **Target Variable:** Status (Phishing vs. Safe Email).

### Methodology:
1. **Data Collection:** Selecting the dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Loading:** Using Pandas to read the CSV file.
3. **Preprocessing:** Cleaning text and handling missing values.
4. **Feature Extraction:** Converting text to numerical data.
5. **Model Training:** Training a classifier (e.g., Random Forest).
6. **Evaluation:** Checking the accuracy and performance.
