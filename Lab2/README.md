# Lab 2: Dataset Selection and Methodology

## 1. Student Information
* **Name:** Mohammed Abullah Al Hashim
* **Course:** ARTI-308 – Machine Learning
* **Major:** Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics

---

## 2. Problem Statement
The objective of this lab is to address a **Classification** problem within the cybersecurity domain. We are working on a **Phishing Email Detection** system. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify emails into two categories:
* **Phishing:** Fraudulent emails intended to steal data.
* **Safe:** Legitimate and secure emails.

## 3. Dataset Description
* **Dataset Name:** Phishing Emails
* **Source:** Kaggle
* **Target Variable:** `label` (0 for Safe, 1 for Phishing)
* **Features:** `text` (The content of the email message)

### Important Note on Dataset File:
The original dataset file exceeds **25MB**, which is the maximum limit for direct file uploads via the GitHub web interface. 
* **Data Access:** You can download the full dataset directly from the source here: [Kaggle - Phishing Emails](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajitmondal/phishing-emails-dataset)
* **Verification:** The data loading, shape, and preview are fully documented and visible in the attached Jupyter Notebook (`Lab2_ML.ipynb`).

## 5. Implementation Details
The project implementation is divided into:
1. **Jupyter Notebook (`Lab2_ML.ipynb`):** Contains the Python code used to load the dataset using Pandas, display its shape, and preview the data.
2. **Methodology:** A structured approach to cleaning text data and preparing it for the classification model.
